# VPNhelper-Windows
This is a tool that connects to your VPN for the first time when you are using Windows.This is suitable for when you have configured the Settings and the interface shows that you are connected, but still cannot proxy the network. (VPN types include PPTP and L2TP, other types do not know whether to support) 
* Warning: This program needs to run under the administrator's permission, otherwise there will be insufficient permission. Please restart your Windows system after running, and then reconnect.
* If the program does not work, you can also go to our Wiki interface for manual instructions.ðŸ‘‰https://github.com/jinjidechefeng/VPNhelper-Windows/wiki
